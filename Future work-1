Validating STAC Item JSON against the STAC specification is a good practice to ensure that your data adheres to the standard. 

You can use the PySTAC library to perform this validation. Here's how you can include validation in your Python script:

1. **Install PySTAC for Validation:**

   If you haven't already installed the PySTAC library, you can do so using pip:

   ```bash
   pip install pystac
   ```

2. **Include Validation in Python Script:**

   After adding the new item to your STAC catalog, you can validate it against the STAC specification using PySTAC.

   ```python
   import json
   from pystac import Catalog, Item, Asset
   from pystac.validation import validate_dict

   # Load the existing STAC catalog
   catalog = Catalog.from_file('datacosmos-stac.json')

   # Assuming you have information about the uploaded file
   new_item = Item(id='unique-id-for-new-item', datetime='date-time-of-the-image')
   
   # Add more metadata to the new item as needed
   # Add assets to the new item (linking to the Google Cloud Storage location)
   new_item.add_asset(key='sentinel-2', asset=Asset(href='gs://your-gcs-bucket/your-file.tif', title='Sentinel-2 Image'))
   
   # Add the new item to the catalog
   catalog.add_item(new_item)
   
   # Validate the new item against the STAC specification
   try:
       validate_dict(new_item.to_dict(), schema_uri='https://schemas.stacspec.org/v1.0.0-beta.2/item-spec/json-schema/item.json')
       print("Item is valid according to the STAC specification.")
   except Exception as e:
       print(f"Item validation failed: {str(e)}")
   
   # Save the updated catalog
   catalog.save('datacosmos-stac.json')
   ```

   In this modified script, we import the `validate_dict` function from `pystac.validation` and use it to validate the new item's JSON representation against the STAC specification. If validation fails, it will raise an exception with an error message.

Make sure to replace the `schema_uri` argument with the appropriate STAC JSON schema URL for the version you are using.

This validation step helps ensure that your STAC catalog and items are compliant with the STAC specification before adding them to your catalog.
