Since I don't have access to DataCosmos or your specific environment, I can provide you with detailed instructions on how to achieve this task.
**Uploading Files to Google Cloud Storage:**

1. **Install and Authenticate Google Cloud SDK:**

   - If you haven't already, install the Google Cloud SDK by following the instructions here: https://cloud.google.com/sdk/install

   - Authenticate the SDK using `gcloud auth login` and follow the prompts to log in to your Google Cloud account.

2. **Create a Google Cloud Storage Bucket:**

   - Use the Google Cloud Console (https://console.cloud.google.com/) to create a new bucket where you want to store your data.

3. **Upload Sentinel-2 Imagery:**

   - Assuming you have a directory with your Sentinel-2 imagery files (e.g., TIFF files), you can use the following command to upload them to your Google Cloud Storage bucket:

     ```bash
     gsutil -m cp /path/to/sentinel2/files/*.tif gs://your-gcs-bucket/
     ```

   Replace `/path/to/sentinel2/files/` with the actual path to your Sentinel-2 files and `your-gcs-bucket` with the name of your Google Cloud Storage bucket.

**Adding Data to STAC Catalog:**

1. **Create or Retrieve STAC Catalog:**

   - If you don't have an existing STAC catalog, you can create one using Python and the PySTAC library (https://pystac.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). Install PySTAC using `pip install pystac`.

   - Alternatively, retrieve the existing STAC catalog JSON file if you already have one.

2. **Python Script to Update STAC Catalog:**

   - Write a Python script to update your STAC catalog. This script should:

     - Read the existing STAC catalog JSON into a Python data structure (e.g., a dictionary).

     - For each uploaded Sentinel-2 image, create a new STAC item in the STAC format, including the required metadata (e.g., `datetime`, `assets`).

     - Append the new STAC item to the `features` array in the STAC catalog.

     - Write the updated data structure back to the STAC catalog JSON file.

   Here's a simplified Python script outline:

   ```python
   import json
   from pystac import Catalog, Item, Asset

   # Load the existing STAC catalog
   catalog = Catalog.from_file('datacosmos-stac.json')

   # Assuming you have information about the uploaded file
   new_item = Item(id='unique-id-for-new-item', datetime='date-time-of-the-image')
   
   # Add more metadata to the new item as needed
   # Add assets to the new item (linking to the Google Cloud Storage location)
   new_item.add_asset(key='sentinel-2', asset=Asset(href='gs://your-gcs-bucket/your-file.tif', title='Sentinel-2 Image'))
   
   # Add the new item to the catalog
   catalog.add_item(new_item)
   
   # Save the updated catalog
   catalog.save('datacosmos-stac.json')
   ```

placeholders like `/path/to/sentinel2/files/` and `your-gcs-bucket` with your actual file paths and bucket names.
